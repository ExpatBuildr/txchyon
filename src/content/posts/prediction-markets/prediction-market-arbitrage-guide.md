# Prediction Market Arbitrage Guide: How to Find & Execute Risk-Free Profits Across Platforms

Arbitrage is the closest thing to free money left in markets. When the same event trades at different probabilities across platforms, you lock in profit regardless of outcome. No crystal ball required, just speed and attention.

Opportunities appear constantly between regulated Kalshi, crypto-native Polymarket, fast-moving Worm.wtf, and niche players. The trick is spotting them before bots or sharp traders close the gap.

# Types of Arbitrage Available

Pure cross-platform: same exact question, different prices. Example: "Will Trump win 2028 nomination?" at 65 percent on Polymarket but 70 percent on Kalshi. Buy Yes cheap, sell expensive, hedge perfectly.

Correlated event arb: closely related outcomes mispriced. Example: state-level election markets implying different national popular vote than direct markets.

Resolution difference arb: markets resolving on slightly different sources or timing.

# Tools You Need

Free: Manifold dashboards, Prediction Market Aggregator sites, Discord bots pinging discrepancies. Paid: Custom scripts watching APIs (Polymarket and Kalshi expose public endpoints).

Worm.wtf moves fastest, so Telegram channels and X alerts help.

# Live Execution Example

Kalshi lists "NFL team to win Super Bowl" at different implied odds than Polymarket futures. If Kalshi Yes on Chiefs costs less than Polymarket equivalent after fees, buy Kalshi Yes, sell Polymarket position. Lock five to ten percent instantly.

Election runoffs often diverge twenty points minutes after polls close. Speed wins.

# Step-by-Step Manual Arb

1. Monitor identical or near-identical markets across platforms.
2. Calculate total cost including fees and slippage.
3. Execute both legs simultaneously (multi-tab life).
4. Hold until resolution or close early if spread tightens.

# Automated Approaches

Simple Python scripts polling APIs work for Polymarket/Kalshi pairs. Worm.wtf requires Solana wallet bots. Start small; exchanges frown on pure arb volume but rarely ban.

# Risks and Limits

Fees eat small edges. Withdrawal delays on some platforms. Resolution disputes affecting only one side (rare but brutal). Liquidity too thin to exit large size.

Stick to liquid majors for safety, niche for bigger spreads.

# Best Current Pairs to Watch

US elections aftermath, major sports championships, Bitcoin price milestones, award shows. Worm.wtf niche vs Polymarket mainstream often diverges sharply.

Pure arb edges shrink fast as the space matures, but they never fully disappear. Humans remain inefficient.
